# Week 6: DAX Basics & Measures in Power BI

## DAX Fundamentals

- Introduced to basic **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** concepts in Power BI  
- Learned how DAX is used to create calculations beyond basic visual aggregation  
- Understood the difference between columns and measures in Power BI  
- Learned how measures are created to perform dynamic calculations based on filters  

## Measures & Calculations

- Created basic measures for numerical columns  
- Used aggregation functions such as SUM, COUNT, and AVERAGE  
- Understood how measures change dynamically based on report filters and slicers  
- Learned the importance of measures for reusable and consistent calculations across visuals  

## CALCULATE Function & Logical Conditions

- Learned the usage of the **CALCULATE()** function to modify filter context  
- Understood how CALCULATE works differently from normal visual filters  
- Learned the difference between slicers (visual filtering) and DAX-based filtering using CALCULATE  
- Implemented logical conditions using **IF()** statements  
- Learned nested IF conditions for handling multiple scenarios in calculations  
- Understood how conditional logic is applied in measures for analysis
