# Natural Disaster Analysis

## Problem Statement
Natural disasters occur frequently across the United States and cause significant impact on lives, infrastructure, and resources. However, raw disaster declaration data is complex and difficult to analyze directly. This project aims to analyze US natural disaster declaration data to understand trends, affected regions, and disaster types, and to support better preparedness and planning through data-driven insights.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) Disaster Declarations dataset. It contains historical records of natural disaster declarations across the United States.
 
The dataset includes key attributes such as disaster type, affected state, declaration date, incident start and end dates, and related program indicators. The data represents real-world operational records and was cleaned and prepared before analysis.

## Key Insights
- Certain states experience a higher frequency of disaster declarations compared to others  
- Floods, storms, and hurricanes are among the most common disaster types  
- Disaster declarations show variation across years, indicating changing trends over time  

## Recommendations
- Focus disaster preparedness and resource planning on highly affected states  
- Use historical disaster trends to improve response planning  
- Strengthen monitoring of frequently occurring disaster types  

## Tools Used
- Power BI (Power Query for data cleaning and dashboard exploration)  
- Python (Jupyter Notebook for data inspection and EDA)
